    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a simple shrimp scampi recipe, sourced from the youtube channel Binging With Babish. 
        <br>Fun Fact: Shrimp Scampi is an amalgamation of many different traditional Italian preparations of scampi (otherwise known as langoustines, Dublin Bay prawns, or Norway Lobsters). Therefore, there isn’t one correct way in which to make it. Try swapping out the pasta in our recipes for rice, or even just a loaf of crusty bread.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tsp kosher salt (+ more to taste) </li>
        <li>½ lb linguine pasta</li>
        <li>3 Tbsp unsalted butter </li>
        <li>2 Tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves, crushed </li>
        <li>¼ tsp crushed red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>½ cup dry white wine</li>
        <li>1 lb frozen shrimp, defrosted and peeled</li>
        <li>1 tsp freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>Juice of 1 large lemon</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp parsley, chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill a large pot ⅔  the way full with water and add 2 teaspoons of salt. Bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat the butter and olive oil over medium-high heat in a large skillet.</li>
        <li>Once the butter is fully melted, add the crushed garlic and red pepper flakes. Cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Add the pasta to the boiling water and cook until al dente according to the instructions on the box.</li>
        <li>Add the wine to the skillet and cook until reduced by half, about 3-5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the shrimp and cook on each side for about 45 seconds to 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Add the lemon juice and stir to incorporate.</li>
        <li>Drain the pasta, but reserve ¼ cup of the water.</li>
        <li>Add the pasta to the skillet and stir to combine. If the sauce looks separated, add the reserved pasta water.</li>
        <li>Season to taste and garnish with parsley.</li>
    </ol>
