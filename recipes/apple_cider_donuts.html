    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is an apple cider donut recipe, sourced from the youtube channel Binging With Babish.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>480 g pressed apple cider</ul>
        <ul>570 g all-purpose flour + more for dusting</ul>
        <ul>1 ½ tsp kosher salt</ul>
        <ul>2 tsp baking powder </ul>
        <ul>¾ tsp baking soda</ul>
        <ul>2 tsp ground cinnamon</ul>
        <ul>½ tsp ground nutmeg</ul>
        <ul>170 g buttermilk, room temperature</ul>
        <ul>1 Tbsp vanilla paste or 1 tsp vanilla extract</ul>
        <ul>125 g  granulated sugar</ul>
        <ul>75 g brown sugar</ul>
        <ul>75 g unsalted butter, room temperature </ul>
        <ul>2 large eggs, room temperature</ul>
        <ul>As needed fry oil </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>In a small sauce pot, reduce the apple cider to about 60 grams or about ¼ cup of liquid.</ol>
        <ol>Allow the boiled cider concentrate to cool to room temperature. </ol>
        <ol>Meanwhile, in a medium bowl whisk together the flour, salt, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Reserve until ready to use.</ol>
        <ol>In a pourable container, combine the cooled apple cider mixture with the buttermilk and vanilla. Reserve until ready to use.</ol>
        <ol>In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine the butter and sugars. Cream the mixture together using a paddle attachment. Continue mixing for 5-6 minutes or until the butter has lightened in color.</ol>
        <ol>Add one egg at a time to the mixture, scraping the sides of the bowl between each addition. </ol>
        <ol>Alternate adding the dry ingredients in three additions and wet ingredients in two additions, starting and ending with the dry ingredients.</ol>
        <ol>Cover the bowl and refrigerate the batter for 1 hour or until it is firm enough to roll out. </ol>
        <ol>Once the dough has chilled, generously dust a cutting board with more flour.</ol>
        <ol>Turn the dough out onto the floured surface and carefully roll or pat the dough out to a circle about ½ inch - ¾ inch thick.</ol>
        <ol>If necessary, refrigerate the dough once more if it has become too soft.</ol>
        <ol>Meanwhile, preheat about 3 inches of oil in a large high-sided skillet or dutch oven to 350 °F. Whisk together the additional sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl for the cinnamon-sugar topping.</ol>
        <ol>Using two biscuit cutters, one larger than the other (we used 3-inch and 1-inch cutters) cut out donuts from the dough. Make sure to save the donut holes.</ol>
        <ol>Working in batches, fry the donuts for about 3-4 minutes on each side.</ol>
        <ol>Transfer the fried donuts to a paper towel-lined sheet tray. Let the donuts cool for 30 seconds or until they are cool enough to handle but are still warm.</ol>
        <ol>Dredge the donuts in the cinnamon-sugar mixture and serve.</ol>
